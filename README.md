# Roku Morning Alarm

### What is the point
As of recent I as a developer have adopted the ways of self-improvement and one of the
ways I plan to do that is to constantly stay motivated and reminded for what I am doing this for one of the ways I plan
on doing this is having specific YouTube videos cast to my roku tv at a certain time every morning.

### How is this done
This will be done in a few steps
 - Locate add set primary roku device you want to use
 - define watch list of YouTube videos/ spotify songs you want to play
 - define the time/times you want the program to execute
 - let it run in the background
